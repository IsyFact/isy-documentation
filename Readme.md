# IsyFact Project Documentation

This repository contains project documentation than can't be assigned to a specific release.
It contains [Antora](https://antora.org/) content sources which are registered in the [playbook of isyfact.github.io](https://github.com/IsyFact/isyfact.github.io/blob/main/antora-playbook.yml).
The content is written in German.

Changes to this repository become effective immediately (i.e. when the according PR is merged).

## Documentation Guide

The documentation guide describes how the [IsyFact online docs](https://isyfact.github.io) are structured, expanded and built.
It explains:

- how certain features of the AsciiDoc markup language should be used,
- pre-defined blocks and markup elements for specific uses (e.g. deprecations, license information),
- project-specific workarounds because of 3rd party limitations (i.e. Antora missing Git LFS support).

## Glossary

The glossary collects fundamental project-specific concepts and definitions.
It provides explanations and describes changes to these concepts and definitions across releases.
